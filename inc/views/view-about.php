You have a right to an open government that works for you.  You pay for it.  You live with it.  And you deserve an equal voice in what government does every day.  KeepTheWebOPEN.com exists to power your participation in government, and hold it accountable.  
<br /><br />
Our first step is to open the legislative and treaty process.  We built Madison – the new tool you met on the home page – to do just that.  Madison is a work in progress, just like the bills and international agreements on here.  But we can’t make Madison better without users like you.  Push it to the limits and tell us what we missed, or what we could do better.
